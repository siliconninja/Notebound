# Notebound

An upcoming note-taking app with containers where you can add text, drawings, and custom modules from websites. The app is written in Python and uses PyGTK/Glade for the GUI.

It is designed to be a more efficient, flexible, convenient, and full-featured alternative to note-taking by hand.
